#MM...FOOD 

```
* AS A food enthusiast
* I WANT food inspiration, and recipes to come along with it
* SO THAT i can eat!!

* GIVEN a simple website, with a button that says, "mm... food"
* WHEN i push the mysterious button
* THEN a picture of a randomly generated, scrumptious food dish appears on the screen
* WHEN i look beneath the picture
* THEN i see mouth watering recipes displayed at my very fingertips
* WHEN i tap or click on one of these recipes
* THEN the recipe appears full screen, so i can read it to completion
